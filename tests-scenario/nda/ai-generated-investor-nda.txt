INVESTOR NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

[ANOMALY: This NDA has an overly broad definition of Confidential Information with no carve-outs or exceptions whatsoever. It also uses ambiguous language like "reasonable steps" and "appropriate measures" without any definitions, and is missing a return/destruction of materials clause entirely.]
