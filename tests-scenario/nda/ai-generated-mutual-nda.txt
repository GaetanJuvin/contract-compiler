   (a) Disclose the Confidential Information to any third party; or
   (b) Use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than the Purpose.

3.2 The Receiving Party shall protect the Confidential Information using the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event less than reasonable care.

3.3 The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information only to its employees, officers, directors, consultants, agents, and advisors (collectively, "Representatives") who (a) have a need to know such information for the Purpose, and (b) are bound by written confidentiality obligations no less restrictive than those contained herein.

3.4 The Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Representatives.

4. COMPELLED DISCLOSURE

4.1 If the Receiving Party is compelled by law, regulation, or legal process to disclose any Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall, to the extent legally permitted, provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy.

4.2 If such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the Receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that confidential treatment is accorded to the disclosed information.

8. REMEDIES

8.1 Each Party acknowledges that any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity.

8.2 The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies available under law or in equity.
