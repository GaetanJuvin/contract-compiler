UNILATERAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

[ANOMALY: This is labeled "Unilateral" but contains symmetric obligations binding both parties equally, which is contradictory for a unilateral NDA where only one party discloses.]

This Unilateral Non-Disclosure Agreement ("Agreement") is made and entered into effective as of February 1, 2026 ("Effective Date"),

BY AND BETWEEN:

Disclosing Party: Orion Defense Systems, Inc., a Virginia corporation, having its registered office at 8200 Greensboro Drive, Suite 1100, McLean, VA 22102 ("Orion" or the "Disclosing Party");

AND

Receiving Party: Meridian Consulting Group, LLP, a limited liability partnership organized under the laws of New York, with offices at 200 Park Avenue, 25th Floor, New York, NY 10166 ("Meridian" or the "Receiving Party").

1.3 Information disclosed orally or visually shall be considered Confidential Information if it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure and confirmed in writing within thirty (30) days thereafter.

ARTICLE 2 -- OBLIGATIONS OF BOTH PARTIES

2.1 Both Parties agree to hold all Confidential Information received from the other Party in strict confidence and to take all reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorized disclosure.

2.3 Both Parties agree not to use any Confidential Information received from the other Party for any purpose other than the Permitted Purpose without the prior written consent of the disclosing Party.

   (a) Is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the Receiving Party;
   (b) Was known to the Receiving Party prior to disclosure, as evidenced by written records;
   (c) Is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information; or
   (d) Is rightfully received from a third party without restriction on disclosure.
