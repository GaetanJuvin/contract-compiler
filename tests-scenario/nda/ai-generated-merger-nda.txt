NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
FOR MERGER AND ACQUISITION DISCUSSIONS

[ANOMALY: This NDA contains contradictory confidentiality periods (Section 5.2 says 2 years, Section 9.3 says "perpetual"), uses ambiguous language throughout ("best efforts," "commercially reasonable," "appropriate" without definitions), and has an asymmetric indemnification clause that only binds the Receiving Party despite this being framed as a mutual exchange of information.]

This Non-Disclosure Agreement for Merger and Acquisition Discussions ("Agreement") is made as of January 10, 2026 (the "Effective Date"),

BETWEEN:

Target Company: Silverlake Manufacturing Group, Inc., a Michigan corporation, having its principal office at 1500 Woodward Avenue, Detroit, MI 48226 ("Silverlake" or the "Target");

AND

Acquirer: Continental Industrial Holdings, PLC, a company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, with its registered office at 25 Cannon Street, London, EC4M 5TA, United Kingdom ("Continental" or the "Acquirer").

Each referred to individually as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties."

PREAMBLE

The Parties intend to engage in discussions and negotiations regarding a potential acquisition, merger, or other business combination transaction (the "Proposed Transaction") pursuant to which Continental may acquire some or all of the equity interests, assets, or business operations of Silverlake.

In connection with the evaluation and negotiation of the Proposed Transaction, each Party may provide the other with access to certain confidential, proprietary, and competitively sensitive information.
