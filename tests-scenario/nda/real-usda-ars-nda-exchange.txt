5. LEGAL COMPULSION

If a Receiving Party is required by court order, subpoena, or governmental mandate to disclose Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such requirement prior to disclosure, to the extent permitted by law, so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy.

6. NO LICENSE
