HEALTHCARE NON-DISCLOSURE AND DATA PROTECTION AGREEMENT

[ANOMALY: This NDA is missing a standard exceptions/exclusions clause for Confidential Information -- there are no carve-outs for publicly known information, independently developed information, or information received from third parties. Additionally, it contains contradictory data retention provisions: Section 6.3 requires destruction within 30 days, while Section 8.4 permits indefinite retention for "quality assurance purposes."]

This Healthcare Non-Disclosure and Data Protection Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of the 1st day of March, 2026, between:

Covered Entity: MedVantage Health Systems, Inc., a nonprofit corporation organized under the laws of the State of Illinois, with its principal place of business at 300 East Randolph Street, Suite 3500, Chicago, IL 60601 ("MedVantage");

Business Associate / Recipient: DataPulse Analytics, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, with offices at 1700 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Suite 500, Washington, DC 20006 ("DataPulse" or the "Recipient").

WHEREAS, DataPulse provides advanced data analytics, population health management, and predictive modeling services to healthcare organizations;

WHEREAS, in connection with the potential engagement of DataPulse by MedVantage to provide analytics services (the "Engagement"), MedVantage may need to share with DataPulse certain confidential business information and de-identified health data;

WHEREAS, the Parties recognize the critical importance of protecting confidential information, patient privacy, and data security in the healthcare industry;

NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:
