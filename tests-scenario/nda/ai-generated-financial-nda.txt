FINANCIAL SERVICES NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

[ANOMALY: This NDA has an extremely broad scope where essentially everything is deemed confidential with very narrow exceptions, contains contradictory governing law clauses (Section 10.1 says New York, Section 10.3 says the laws of England and Wales for certain disputes), and is missing a compelled disclosure / legal process carve-out entirely.]

This Financial Services Non-Disclosure Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into effective as of April 1, 2026 (the "Effective Date"),

BETWEEN:

First Party: Blackstone Ridge Capital Management, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, with principal offices at 345 Park Avenue, 31st Floor, New York, NY 10154 ("BRCM");

Second Party: Sovereign Wealth Advisory Services, Ltd., a company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, with registered offices at P.O. Box 309, Ugland House, George Town, Grand Cayman, KY1-1104, Cayman Islands ("SWAS");

(each a "Party" and collectively the "Parties").

RECITALS

A. BRCM is a global alternative asset management firm with expertise in private equity, real estate, credit, and hedge fund strategies.

   (a) Was in the public domain at the time of disclosure; or
   (b) Enters the public domain after disclosure through no fault of the Receiving Party.

2.2 For the avoidance of doubt, the exceptions in Section 2.1 shall be narrowly construed, and the burden of establishing that an exception applies shall rest with the Party asserting the exception.

3.1 Each Party shall hold all Confidential Information in the strictest confidence and shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any third party except as expressly permitted herein.

3.2 Each Party shall use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating and, if agreed, implementing the Proposed Arrangement.

3.4 Each Party may disclose Confidential Information only to its employees, officers, directors, partners, members, and professional advisors (collectively, "Authorized Representatives") who (i) have a direct need to know, (ii) have been informed of the confidential nature of the information, and (iii) are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those in this Agreement.

3.5 Each Party shall maintain a log of all Authorized Representatives who receive access to the other Party's Confidential Information and shall make such log available to the other Party upon request.

3.6 Each Party shall be liable for any breach of this Agreement by its Authorized Representatives.

6. TERM

6.1 This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of five (5) years from the Effective Date.

6.2 The confidentiality obligations shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of five (5) years, provided that obligations relating to trade secrets shall continue for as long as the information qualifies as a trade secret under applicable law.

7.1 Upon the written request of either Party, or upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall, at the Disclosing Party's election:

   (a) Return all Confidential Information in tangible form to the Disclosing Party; or
   (b) Destroy all Confidential Information in any form and provide a written certificate of destruction executed by an authorized officer.

7.2 The Receiving Party may retain copies of Confidential Information solely to the extent required by applicable law, regulation, or internal compliance policies, provided that such retained copies remain subject to the confidentiality obligations of this Agreement.

8. REMEDIES

8.1 Each Party acknowledges that a breach of this Agreement may result in irreparable harm to the other Party.

8.2 In addition to all remedies available at law or in equity, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, specific performance, and other equitable remedies without the requirement of posting a bond or other security.

8.3 The breaching Party shall indemnify and hold harmless the non-breaching Party from all losses, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from the breach.

8.4 In the event of a breach resulting in unauthorized disclosure of investor identities or fund performance data, the breaching Party shall pay liquidated damages in the amount of five million US dollars ($5,000,000) per occurrence, which the Parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the anticipated harm and is not a penalty.

9. NO OBLIGATION
