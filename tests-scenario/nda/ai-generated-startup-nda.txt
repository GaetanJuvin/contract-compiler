NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

[ANOMALY: This startup NDA has multiple issues: (1) the definition of Confidential Information is vague and circular ("information that is confidential"), (2) there are no exceptions to confidentiality at all -- no exclusions for public domain, independent development, or prior knowledge, (3) the term is "perpetual" which is unusual and potentially unenforceable, (4) there is no return/destruction of materials clause, and (5) the non-compete provision in Section 6 is extremely broad and likely unenforceable.]
