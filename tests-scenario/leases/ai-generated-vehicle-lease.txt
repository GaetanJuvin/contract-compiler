(e) subleasing to third parties.

6.3 Authorized Drivers. Vehicles shall be operated only by Lessee's employees who are at
least twenty-one (21) years of age, hold a valid driver's license of the appropriate class,
and have an acceptable driving record. Lessee shall maintain a list of authorized drivers

vehicles, provided such wraps are professionally installed and removed, and the vehicles are
returned without residue or damage from such applications.

ARTICLE 7. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR

7.1 Maintenance Program. Lessor shall provide a maintenance program covering the following
services for the duration of the Lease Term at no additional cost:

    (a) All manufacturer-recommended scheduled maintenance services;
    (b) Oil changes, filter replacements, and fluid top-offs;
    (c) Tire rotations (tires themselves are Lessee's responsibility);
    (d) Brake inspections;
    (e) Multi-point vehicle inspections.

        within 500 miles or 30 days of the recommended service interval;
    (b) Maintain accurate maintenance records for each vehicle;
    (c) Promptly report any mechanical issues, warning lights, or safety concerns;
    (d) Maintain proper fluid levels between service intervals;
    (e) Replace tires when tread depth reaches 4/32" or less.

7.3 Repairs. Mechanical repairs arising from defects or normal operation shall be covered
under the manufacturer's warranty during the warranty period. Repairs arising from
Lessee's misuse, negligence, or failure to perform scheduled maintenance shall be at
Lessee's sole expense.

7.4 Downtime Vehicles. In the event any vehicle requires repairs expected to take more
than three (3) business days, Lessor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
a comparable substitute vehicle at no additional charge. Substitute vehicles are subject
to availability.

        full replacement value;

8.4 Deductibles. Maximum allowable deductibles: $2,500 for comprehensive; $2,500 for
collision. Lessee is responsible for all deductible amounts.

delivery and upon each policy renewal.

ARTICLE 9. LOSS, DAMAGE, AND TOTAL LOSS

9.1 Reporting. Lessee shall report any accident, theft, or damage to Lessor within
twenty-four (24) hours and to appropriate law enforcement and insurance carriers promptly.

9.2 Repair of Damage. Lessee shall repair all damage to the vehicles promptly, using parts
of at least OEM quality, at an authorized repair facility approved by Lessor.

9.3 Total Loss. In the event of a total loss or theft of any vehicle, Lessee shall pay
Lessor the greater of: (a) the outstanding balance of all remaining Lease Payments for
that vehicle; or (b) the fair market value of the vehicle at the time of loss.

[ANOMALY: Section 9.3 requires Lessee to pay the GREATER of remaining payments or FMV.
Standard gap provisions typically cover only the FMV. This creates a situation where
Lessee could owe significantly more than the vehicle is worth -- an asymmetric term.]

ARTICLE 10. END-OF-LEASE OPTIONS

10.1 At the expiration of the Lease Term, Lessee shall elect one of the following options
for each vehicle:

    (a) Return: Return the vehicle in accordance with Article 11;
    (b) Purchase: Purchase the vehicle at its then-fair market value, as determined by
        Lessor based on published wholesale values;
    (c) Extend: Extend the lease for an additional twelve (12) months at a monthly rate
        to be mutually agreed upon, but not to exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the
        original monthly Lease Payment.

10.2 Notice. Lessee must notify Lessor of its election at least sixty (60) days prior to
the expiration of the Lease Term.

ARTICLE 11. VEHICLE RETURN

11.1 Return Condition. Vehicles shall be returned in good condition, subject to normal
wear and tear guidelines as defined in Exhibit A (Wear and Use Standards).

11.2 Excess Wear Charges. Lessee shall be charged for any damage or condition that exceeds
the normal wear and use standards, including but not limited to: dents, scratches, broken
glass, tire wear below 4/32", interior stains, burns, tears, mechanical damage, and
missing equipment.

11.3 Return Location. Vehicles shall be returned to Lessor's designated return facility in
Portland, Oregon, or such other location as Lessor may specify.

11.4 Inspection. Lessor shall inspect each vehicle within five (5) business days of return
and provide Lessee with a written report of any excess wear charges.

ARTICLE 12. DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

12.1 Events of Default. The following constitute events of default: (a) failure to pay
Lease Payments within fifteen (15) days of the due date; (b) breach of insurance
requirements; (c) unauthorized use, sublease, or relocation of vehicles; (d) bankruptcy
or insolvency of Lessee; (e) material misrepresentation; (f) failure to maintain vehicles
in accordance with Article 7.

12.2 Remedies. Upon default, Lessor may: (a) terminate this Agreement; (b) take immediate
possession of all vehicles; (c) recover all remaining Lease Payments plus damages;
(d) pursue any other available remedy.

12.3 Repossession. In the event of repossession, Lessee shall make vehicles available at
Lessee's principal place of business and shall not interfere with Lessor's repossession
efforts. Lessee shall be liable for all repossession costs.

ARTICLE 13. INDEMNIFICATION

13.1 Lessee shall indemnify and hold Lessor harmless from all claims, losses, damages,
liabilities, and expenses arising from Lessee's use, operation, maintenance, possession,
or return of the vehicles. This indemnity shall survive termination.

ARTICLE 14. MISCELLANEOUS

14.1 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Michigan.

[ANOMALY: The Lessee is based in Oregon, the vehicles are used in Oregon/Washington, but
governing law is Michigan (Lessor's state). This may create forum inconvenience for
Lessee. Additionally, there is no dispute resolution clause -- no arbitration, mediation,
or forum selection -- just governing law.]

14.2 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties.

14.3 Amendments. No amendment shall be effective unless in writing signed by both parties.

14.4 Notices. All notices shall be in writing and sent by certified mail or overnight
courier to the addresses above.

14.5 Assignment. Lessor may assign this Agreement without Lessee's consent. Lessee may
not assign without Lessor's prior written consent.

14.6 Severability. Invalid provisions shall not affect the remainder of this Agreement.

14.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Commercial Vehicle Fleet Lease
