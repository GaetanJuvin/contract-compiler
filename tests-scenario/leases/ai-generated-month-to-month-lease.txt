MONTH-TO-MONTH RESIDENTIAL RENTAL AGREEMENT

THIS MONTH-TO-MONTH RESIDENTIAL RENTAL AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is entered into as of the
1st day of March, 2026, by and between:

LANDLORD: Sunbelt Rental Properties, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, with its
principal address at 3400 Bayshore Boulevard, Suite 1200, Tampa, FL 33629 ("Landlord")

TENANT: Javier M. Reyes, an individual currently residing at 910 Henderson Avenue,
Apt. 3C, Tampa, FL 33602 ("Tenant")

IN CONSIDERATION of the mutual promises contained herein and the rental payments to be
made by Tenant, the parties agree as follows:

SECTION 1. PREMISES

1.1 Landlord rents to Tenant the residential property located at 2715 Swann Avenue,
Unit B, Tampa, FL 33609 (the "Premises"), consisting of a two-bedroom, one-bathroom
apartment of approximately 950 square feet, including one (1) assigned parking space.

1.2 The Premises are rented in their current "as-is" condition. Tenant acknowledges having
inspected the Premises and accepts them in their present state.

SECTION 2. TERM

2.1 This Agreement shall commence on March 15, 2026, and shall continue on a
month-to-month basis until terminated by either party.

2.2 Either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to the other
party at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the desired termination date.

[ANOMALY: Florida Statute Section 83.57 requires at least 15 days' notice before the end
of any monthly period for month-to-month tenancies. However, this clause could be read
to allow mid-month termination with only 15 days notice, which is ambiguous.]

SECTION 3. RENT

3.1 Tenant agrees to pay a monthly rent of One Thousand Six Hundred Fifty Dollars
($1,650.00), due on the first (1st) day of each calendar month.

3.2 A late fee of Seventy-Five Dollars ($75.00) will be assessed if rent is not received
by the fifth (5th) day of the month.

3.3 Rent shall be paid by personal check, cashier's check, or electronic payment to the
account specified by Landlord. Cash payments are not accepted.

3.4 If any check is returned for insufficient funds, Tenant shall pay a returned check
fee of Thirty-Five Dollars ($35.00), and all future payments must be made by cashier's
check or money order.

3.5 Landlord may increase the rent at any time upon thirty (30) days' written notice to
Tenant.

SECTION 4. SECURITY DEPOSIT

4.1 Upon execution of this Agreement, Tenant has deposited with Landlord the sum of One
Thousand Six Hundred Fifty Dollars ($1,650.00) as a security deposit.

4.2 The security deposit shall be held by Landlord in accordance with Florida Statute
Section 83.49. Landlord elects to hold the deposit in a non-interest-bearing account at
Regions Bank, Tampa, Florida.

4.3 The security deposit may be applied against unpaid rent, damages beyond normal wear
and tear, and other amounts owed under this Agreement.

4.4 Within thirty (30) days after Tenant vacates, Landlord shall return the deposit or
provide written notice of Landlord's intent to impose a claim on the deposit, in
accordance with Florida law.

SECTION 5. UTILITIES

5.1 Tenant shall be responsible for all utilities, including electricity, water, sewer,
gas, internet, cable television, and telephone.

5.2 Landlord shall be responsible for trash collection service.

SECTION 6. USE AND OCCUPANCY

6.1 The Premises shall be occupied solely by Tenant. No other persons shall reside at the
Premises without the prior written approval of Landlord.

6.2 The Premises shall be used exclusively for residential purposes.

6.3 Tenant shall not engage in any illegal activity on the Premises.

6.4 Tenant shall not disturb the quiet enjoyment of neighboring tenants.

SECTION 7. PETS

7.1 No pets of any kind are permitted on the Premises without the prior written consent
of Landlord. If consent is granted, Tenant shall pay a non-refundable pet fee of $300.00
and an additional monthly pet rent of $50.00.

SECTION 8. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS

8.1 Tenant shall keep the Premises clean and in good condition.

8.2 Tenant shall promptly notify Landlord of any needed repairs or unsafe conditions.

8.3 Tenant shall be responsible for all repairs necessitated by Tenant's negligence or
misuse.

8.4 Landlord shall maintain the Premises in compliance with applicable housing codes,
including maintaining the roof, structural components, plumbing, heating, and electrical
systems in reasonable working condition.

8.5 Tenant shall be responsible for replacing light bulbs, smoke detector batteries, HVAC
air filters, and maintaining the garbage disposal and dishwasher in working order.

SECTION 9. ALTERATIONS

9.1 Tenant shall not make any alterations, including painting, wallpapering, or installing
fixtures, without the prior written consent of Landlord.

9.2 Any approved alterations become the property of Landlord upon installation, unless
otherwise agreed in writing.

SECTION 10. ENTRY BY LANDLORD

10.1 Landlord may enter the Premises at reasonable times with at least twelve (12) hours'
notice for the purposes of inspection, maintenance, repairs, or showing the property to
prospective tenants or buyers.

10.2 In case of emergency, Landlord may enter without notice.

SECTION 11. INSURANCE

11.1 Landlord is not responsible for Tenant's personal property. Tenant is strongly
encouraged to obtain renter's insurance.

[ANOMALY: The lease merely "encourages" renter's insurance rather than requiring it --
a missing standard provision that many landlords now mandate.]

SECTION 12. PARKING

12.1 Tenant is assigned one (1) parking space, Space #B-4. Only registered vehicles in
operable condition may be parked in assigned spaces.

12.2 No boats, trailers, RVs, or commercial vehicles may be parked on the property.

SECTION 13. DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

13.1 If Tenant fails to pay rent or breaches any term of this Agreement, Landlord may
serve a three-day notice as required by Florida law. If Tenant fails to comply, Landlord
may commence eviction proceedings.

13.2 Tenant shall be liable for Landlord's costs of enforcement, including reasonable
attorneys' fees and court costs.

13.3 If Landlord fails to maintain the Premises in habitable condition, Tenant may
exercise remedies available under Florida Statute Chapter 83, Part II.

SECTION 14. ABANDONMENT

14.1 If Tenant is absent from the Premises for a period exceeding fifteen (15) consecutive
days without prior notice to Landlord and rent is unpaid, Landlord may deem the Premises
abandoned and may re-enter and re-let the Premises.

SECTION 15. LEAD-BASED PAINT

15.1 The property was built in 2012; therefore, the lead-based paint disclosure
requirements of 42 U.S.C. 4852d are not applicable.

SECTION 16. MOLD DISCLOSURE

16.1 Landlord has no knowledge of mold on the Premises. Tenant shall promptly report any
visible mold growth or water intrusion to Landlord.

SECTION 17. HURRICANE AND STORM PROVISIONS

17.1 In the event of a hurricane warning, Tenant shall take reasonable precautions to
secure outdoor furniture and loose items on patios and balconies.

17.2 Landlord is not liable for damage caused by hurricanes, tropical storms, or other
acts of God.

SECTION 18. GOVERNING LAW

18.1 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of Florida, specifically Chapter 83, Florida Statutes (the Florida Residential
Landlord and Tenant Act).

SECTION 19. ENTIRE AGREEMENT

19.1 This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties and
supersedes all prior agreements and representations, whether written or oral.
