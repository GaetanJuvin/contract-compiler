periods each, by providing not less than nine (9) months' written notice prior to

2.3 Right of First Refusal. Tenant shall have a right of first refusal to lease any
adjacent space in Building C that becomes available during the Lease Term, on the same
terms offered to any bona fide third-party prospective tenant.

SECTION 3. RENT

3.1 Base Rent. Tenant shall pay Base Rent according to the following schedule:

    Years 1-3:    $7.25/sq ft/year   ($326,250.00/year;  $27,187.50/month)

3.2 NNN Lease. This is a triple-net ("NNN") lease. In addition to Base Rent, Tenant
shall pay as Additional Rent its proportionate share of: (a) real estate taxes and
assessments; (b) property insurance premiums; and (c) common area maintenance expenses,
currently estimated at $2.15/sq ft/year.

3.3 Tenant's proportionate share shall be 28.13%, calculated as the ratio of the
Premises (45,000 sq. ft.) to the total leasable area of the Park (159,950 sq. ft.).

3.4 Payment. All Rent shall be paid monthly in advance on the first (1st) day of each
month by wire transfer or ACH payment. A late fee of five percent (5%) shall be assessed
on any payment not received within seven (7) days of the due date.

SECTION 4. SECURITY DEPOSIT

4.1 Deposit. Upon execution, Tenant shall deliver a security deposit of $81,562.50,
equal to three (3) months of initial Base Rent.

4.2 Application and Return. The Security Deposit may be applied to cure any Tenant default.
The Security Deposit, less lawful deductions, shall be returned within sixty (60) days
following Tenant's surrender of the Premises.

SECTION 5. USE

5.1 Permitted Use. The Premises shall be used for warehousing, distribution, light
assembly, and ancillary office uses related to Tenant's freight logistics business.

5.2 Prohibited Uses. Tenant shall not use the Premises for heavy manufacturing, retail
sales to the public, residential purposes, or for the storage of hazardous or explosive
materials except as permitted in Section 12.

5.3 Hours of Operation. Tenant may operate twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days
per week, subject to applicable noise ordinances and the Park's rules regarding overnight
truck idling.

SECTION 6. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS

6.1 Tenant's Obligations. As this is a triple-net lease, Tenant shall be responsible for
all maintenance, repair, and replacement of the following, at Tenant's sole cost:

    (a) Interior of the Premises, including walls, floors, and ceilings;
    (b) All doors, including dock doors, overhead doors, and grade-level doors;
    (c) HVAC systems serving the Premises;
    (d) Plumbing and electrical systems within the Premises;
    (e) The roof membrane and roof drainage systems;
    (f) The foundation and structural components of the Building;
    (g) Fire suppression and life safety systems within the Premises;

    (i) All exterior lighting fixtures serving the Premises.

[ANOMALY: Section 6.1(e) and (f) make Tenant responsible for roof, foundation, and
structural components -- these are typically Landlord responsibilities even in NNN leases.
This is an asymmetric/unfair allocation of structural repair costs to the Tenant.]

or modifications to the roof, foundation, or building systems shall require Landlord's
prior written consent.

and other trade equipment without Landlord's consent, provided such installations do not
compromise the structural integrity of the Building.

cost; (e) workers' compensation as required by law; (f) environmental/pollution liability

terminate as of the date of taking, and Rent shall be adjusted to the date of termination.
