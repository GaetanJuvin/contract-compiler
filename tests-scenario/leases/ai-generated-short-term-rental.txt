grill in a safe manner and clean it after each use. Charcoal grills are prohibited.

SECTION 7. GUEST RESPONSIBILITIES

7.1 Care of Property. Guest shall exercise reasonable care in the use of the Property and
its contents and shall leave the Property in substantially the same condition as found,
subject to normal use during the rental period.

7.2 Reporting Damage. Guest shall promptly report any damage, malfunction, or maintenance
issue to Owner or Owner's property manager at (843) 555-0192.

SECTION 8. OWNER'S RESPONSIBILITIES

8.1 Habitable Condition. Owner shall provide the Property in a clean, sanitary, and
habitable condition, with all appliances and systems in good working order.

8.2 Maintenance. Owner shall be responsible for maintenance and repairs to the Property,
including plumbing, electrical, HVAC, and appliance repair. Owner shall respond to urgent
maintenance requests within four (4) hours during business hours.

8.3 Supplies. Owner shall provide an initial supply of toilet paper, paper towels, dish
soap, dishwasher detergent, laundry detergent, trash bags, and basic cleaning supplies.
Replenishment during the stay is Guest's responsibility.

SECTION 9. LIABILITY AND INSURANCE

9.1 Limitation of Liability. Owner shall not be liable for any injury, loss, or damage to
Guest or Guest's personal property arising from Guest's use of the Property, the pool, hot
tub, beach, or any amenities, except to the extent caused by Owner's gross negligence or
willful misconduct.

9.2 Hold Harmless. Guest agrees to indemnify and hold Owner harmless from any claims,
damages, or expenses arising from Guest's use of the Property or any violation of this
Agreement.

9.3 Travel Insurance. Owner strongly recommends that Guest purchase travel insurance to
protect against trip cancellation, interruption, and personal property loss. Owner is not
responsible for trip cancellation costs.

[ANOMALY: No requirement for Guest to carry renter's or liability insurance, and Owner
does not disclose whether the property is covered under a commercial rental insurance
policy. The "hold harmless" clause in 9.2 is broadly one-sided with no corresponding
Owner indemnification beyond the vague "gross negligence" exception in 9.1.]

SECTION 10. ENTRY BY OWNER

10.1 Owner or Owner's agents may enter the Property without prior notice in case of
emergency. For non-emergency purposes (such as maintenance or inspection), Owner shall
provide at least four (4) hours' notice.

[ANOMALY: South Carolina law generally requires reasonable notice for landlord entry.
"Four hours" is significantly less than the typical 24-hour standard. For a vacation
rental, this short notice period, combined with unrestricted emergency entry without
defining "emergency," gives Owner broad access rights.]

SECTION 11. TERMINATION

11.1 By Owner. Owner may immediately terminate this Agreement and require Guest to vacate
the Property if Guest: (a) exceeds the maximum occupancy; (b) hosts unauthorized parties
or events; (c) engages in illegal activity; (d) causes significant damage to the Property;
(e) violates the no-smoking or no-pet policies; or (f) disturbs neighboring properties
after one warning.

11.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination under Section 11.1, Guest shall vacate within
two (2) hours. No refund of rental fees or security deposit shall be provided.

11.3 By Guest. Guest may terminate this Agreement at any time by vacating the Property.
The cancellation policy in Section 5 shall apply with respect to any refund.

SECTION 12. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

12.1 Informal Resolution. The parties shall first attempt to resolve any dispute
informally by direct communication.

12.2 Mediation. If informal resolution fails, the dispute shall be submitted to mediation
in Horry County, South Carolina.

12.3 Litigation. If mediation fails, any legal action shall be brought exclusively in the
courts of Horry County, South Carolina. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.

SECTION 13. GOVERNING LAW

13.1 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of South Carolina.

SECTION 14. FORCE MAJEURE

14.1 Neither party shall be liable for failure to perform due to circumstances beyond
their reasonable control, including natural disasters, hurricanes, pandemics, acts of
terrorism, or government-mandated closures. In such event, Owner shall provide a prorated
refund for unused nights or, at Guest's option, a credit toward a future stay of equal
value.

SECTION 15. MISCELLANEOUS

15.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties.

15.2 Amendments. No modification shall be effective unless in writing and signed by both
parties.

15.3 Severability. If any provision is held invalid, the remaining provisions shall
continue in full force.

    Owner: reservations@bluehorizonrentals.com

15.5 Electronic Signature. The parties agree that electronic signatures shall have the
same force and effect as original signatures.
