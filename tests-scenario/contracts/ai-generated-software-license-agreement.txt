RECITALS

WHEREAS, Licensor is the owner and developer of the proprietary enterprise resource planning software known as "NovaTech ERP Suite" (the "Software"); and

WHEREAS, Licensee desires to obtain a license to use the Software for its business operations;

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

1. GRANT OF LICENSE

1.1 License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and Licensee's payment of all applicable License Fees, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use the Software on Licensee's computer systems, solely for Licensee's internal business operations.

1.2 License Scope. The license granted herein permits Licensee to install the Software on up to fifty (50) designated workstations and two (2) servers located at Licensee's principal place of business.

1.3 Copies. Licensee may make one (1) copy of the Software solely for archival or backup purposes, provided that all copyright notices and proprietary markings are reproduced on such copy.

1.4 Restrictions. Licensee shall not: (a) sublicense, lease, rent, loan, or distribute the Software to any third party; (b) modify, translate, adapt, or create derivative works based on the Software; (c) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the Software, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law; (d) remove or alter any proprietary notices on the Software; (e) use the Software to develop any software or service that competes with the Software; or (f) use the Software in any manner that exceeds the scope of the license granted herein.

1.5 License Revocation. Licensor reserves the right to revoke this license at any time, for any reason, upon written notice to Licensee. [ANOMALY: Contradicts Section 8.2 which requires cause for termination]

2. LICENSE FEES AND PAYMENT

2.1 License Fee. In consideration for the license granted herein, Licensee shall pay Licensor an initial license fee of $275,000.00 (the "License Fee"), due and payable within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date.

2.2 Annual Maintenance Fee. Commencing on the first anniversary of the Effective Date, Licensee shall pay an annual maintenance and support fee equal to twenty percent (20%) of the then-current list price of the Software (the "Maintenance Fee"). The Maintenance Fee shall be due and payable annually in advance.

2.3 Payment Terms. All payments shall be made in United States Dollars by wire transfer or check. Licensee shall pay all applicable taxes, duties, and assessments related to the license, excluding taxes based on Licensor's net income.

2.4 Late Payments. Overdue amounts shall bear interest at the rate of two percent (2%) per month, compounding monthly, from the date due until paid in full. Licensor may suspend Licensee's access to maintenance and support services for any payments overdue by more than fifteen (15) days.

2.5 Audit Rights. Licensor shall have the right, upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice, to audit Licensee's use of the Software to verify compliance with this Agreement. Audits shall be conducted during normal business hours and shall not unreasonably interfere with Licensee's operations. If an audit reveals unauthorized use, Licensee shall pay the applicable License Fees for such unauthorized use, plus Licensor's reasonable audit costs.

3. DELIVERY AND INSTALLATION

3.1 Delivery. Licensor shall deliver the Software to Licensee in electronic format within ten (10) business days following receipt of the License Fee.

3.2 Installation. Licensor shall provide reasonable installation assistance at no additional charge. Installation shall be completed within thirty (30) calendar days following delivery.

3.3 Acceptance. Licensee shall have thirty (30) days following installation to test the Software and notify Licensor of any material defects or non-conformities (the "Acceptance Period"). If Licensee does not provide written notice of rejection during the Acceptance Period, the Software shall be deemed accepted.

3.4 Rejection. If Licensee rejects the Software under Section 3.3, Licensor shall have sixty (60) days to cure the identified defects. If Licensor fails to cure, Licensee may terminate this Agreement and receive a full refund of the License Fee, subject to the provisions of Section 9.3. [ANOMALY: Section 9.3 discusses limitation of liability, not refund procedures - circular reference]

4. MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT

4.1 Scope. During any period for which Licensee has paid the Maintenance Fee, Licensor shall provide: (a) bug fixes and patches to correct errors in the Software; (b) updates and upgrades to the Software as they become generally available; (c) telephone and email technical support during business hours (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM Pacific Time, Monday through Friday); and (d) access to Licensor's online knowledge base and support portal.

4.2 Response Times. Licensor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to support requests as follows:
    - Critical (system down): 4 hours
    - High (major function impaired): 8 business hours
    - Medium (minor function impaired): 2 business days
    - Low (general questions): 5 business days

4.3 Exclusions. Licensor shall have no obligation to provide maintenance or support for issues arising from: (a) modification of the Software by anyone other than Licensor; (b) use of the Software with hardware or software not approved by Licensor; (c) Licensee's failure to implement updates or patches provided by Licensor; or (d) misuse, abuse, or negligent use of the Software.

4.4 Reinstatement. If Licensee allows its maintenance coverage to lapse, reinstatement shall require payment of all unpaid Maintenance Fees for the lapsed period, plus a reinstatement fee equal to fifty percent (50%) of one year's Maintenance Fee.

5. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

5.1 Ownership. The Software, including all copies, modifications, enhancements, and derivative works thereof, and all intellectual property rights therein, are and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of Licensor. Licensee acquires no ownership rights in the Software under this Agreement.

5.2 Copyright Notice. Licensee shall not remove, alter, or obscure any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notice on the Software.

5.3 Infringement Claims. If the Software becomes the subject of an intellectual property infringement claim, Licensor may, at its sole discretion: (a) modify the Software to make it non-infringing; (b) obtain a license for Licensee's continued use; or (c) terminate this Agreement and refund a pro-rata portion of the License Fee based on a five-year straight-line depreciation from the Effective Date.

6. CONFIDENTIALITY

6.1 Definition. Each Party's "Confidential Information" includes all non-public information disclosed by such Party to the other Party in connection with this Agreement, including the terms of this Agreement, business plans, technical data, product plans, and financial information. The Software and its source code, algorithms, and architecture constitute Licensor's Confidential Information.

6.2 Obligations. The receiving Party shall: (a) maintain the confidentiality of the disclosing Party's Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information, but no less than reasonable care; (b) not disclose such Confidential Information to any third party without the disclosing Party's prior written consent; and (c) use such Confidential Information solely for the purposes of this Agreement.

6.3 Exceptions. Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving Party; (b) was lawfully in the receiving Party's possession prior to disclosure; (c) is independently developed by the receiving Party; or (d) is rightfully received from a third party without restriction.

6.4 Return of Materials. Upon termination of this Agreement, each Party shall promptly return or destroy all Confidential Information of the other Party, except that Licensee's legal department may retain one archival copy for compliance purposes. [ANOMALY: Contradicts Section 8.5 which says ALL copies must be destroyed with no exceptions]

7. WARRANTIES

7.1 Licensor Warranty. Licensor warrants that for a period of ninety (90) days following acceptance (the "Warranty Period"), the Software will perform materially in accordance with its published specifications and documentation. Licensor's sole obligation under this warranty is to use reasonable efforts to correct any reproducible error reported by Licensee during the Warranty Period.

7.2 DISCLAIMER. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTY IN SECTION 7.1, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR QUIET ENJOYMENT. LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET LICENSEE'S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT ITS OPERATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.

7.3 Licensee Acknowledgment. Licensee acknowledges that the Software is a complex product and that defects may exist. Licensee assumes all risk regarding the selection, use, and results obtained from the Software.

8. TERM AND TERMINATION

8.1 Term. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue in perpetuity unless terminated in accordance with this Section 8. [ANOMALY: Contradicts Section 1.1 which says the license is "revocable"]

8.2 Termination for Cause. Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon sixty (60) days' written notice if the other Party materially breaches any provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within the sixty-day notice period. [ANOMALY: Contradicts Section 1.5 which allows Licensor to revoke "at any time, for any reason"]

8.3 Termination by Licensor. Licensor may terminate this Agreement immediately, without notice, if Licensee: (a) fails to pay any amount when due and such failure continues for more than thirty (30) days; (b) breaches Section 1.4 (Restrictions); (c) breaches Section 6 (Confidentiality); or (d) becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy. [ANOMALY: Asymmetric - Licensor can terminate immediately but Licensee must provide 60 days' notice per 8.2]

8.4 No Termination for Convenience by Licensee. Licensee may not terminate this Agreement for convenience. Licensee's sole right to terminate is as set forth in Section 8.2.

8.5 Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason: (a) all licenses granted hereunder shall immediately terminate; (b) Licensee shall immediately cease all use of the Software; (c) Licensee shall destroy all copies of the Software in its possession or control, including all archival copies, and certify such destruction in writing to Licensor within ten (10) days; and (d) all amounts owed to Licensor shall become immediately due and payable. [ANOMALY: Contradicts Section 6.4 which permits Licensee to retain an archival copy]

8.6 Survival. Sections 5 (Intellectual Property), 6 (Confidentiality), 7.2 (Disclaimer), 9 (Limitation of Liability), and 10 (Indemnification) shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 Cap. LICENSOR'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE LICENSE FEE ACTUALLY PAID BY LICENSEE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. [ANOMALY: Asymmetric - cap only applies to Licensor, no reciprocal cap for Licensee]

9.2 Exclusion of Damages. IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, goodwill, data, or other intangible losses, even if Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. [ANOMALY: Asymmetric - exclusion only benefits Licensor]

9.3 Essential Basis. The limitations set forth in this Section 9 shall apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, and shall survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. The Parties acknowledge that the limitations of liability set forth herein are an essential element of the bargain between the Parties, as referenced in Section 3.4. [ANOMALY: Circular reference - Section 3.4 references Section 9.3 for refund procedures, and Section 9.3 references the "bargain" without addressing refunds]

10. INDEMNIFICATION

10.1 By Licensee. Licensee shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Licensor and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising out of: (a) Licensee's use of the Software; (b) Licensee's breach of this Agreement; (c) any claim by a third party related to Licensee's products or services that utilize the Software; or (d) Licensee's violation of any applicable law or regulation. [ANOMALY: No reciprocal indemnification by Licensor - highly asymmetric]

11. GENERAL PROVISIONS

11.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, and negotiations.

11.2 Amendments. This Agreement may only be amended by a written instrument signed by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensor may update the terms of this Agreement from time to time by posting revised terms on its website, with such changes becoming effective thirty (30) days after posting. [ANOMALY: Contradicts first sentence - allows unilateral amendment by Licensor]

11.3 Waiver. No waiver shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the waiving Party.

11.4 Severability. If any provision is held invalid, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

11.5 Assignment. Licensee may not assign this Agreement without Licensor's prior written consent. Licensor may assign this Agreement freely without Licensee's consent.

11.6 Notices. All notices shall be in writing and delivered to the addresses set forth in the preamble, by certified mail, overnight courier, or email.

11.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts.

[NOTE: No Force Majeure clause - ANOMALY: Missing standard provision]
[NOTE: No Governing Law clause - ANOMALY: Missing standard provision]
