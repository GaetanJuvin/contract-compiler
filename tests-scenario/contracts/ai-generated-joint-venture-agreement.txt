JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT

[ANOMALY CONTRACT - Contains contradictory voting provisions, ambiguous profit distribution, circular references, and asymmetric exit rights]

This Joint Venture Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of January 25, 2026 ("Effective Date"), by and between:

PARTY A: Titan Construction Group, Inc., a Florida corporation with its principal offices at 200 South Biscayne Boulevard, Suite 3200, Miami, FL 33131 ("Titan")

and

PARTY B: GreenPath Environmental Solutions, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company with its principal offices at 1600 Stout Street, Suite 1400, Denver, CO 80202 ("GreenPath")

(each a "Venturer" and collectively the "Venturers")

RECITALS

WHEREAS, Titan is an established construction company with expertise in commercial and infrastructure construction projects throughout the southeastern United States; and

WHEREAS, GreenPath is a leading environmental services and sustainable construction firm with proprietary green building technologies and environmental remediation capabilities; and

WHEREAS, the Venturers desire to form a joint venture for the purpose of pursuing and performing sustainable construction and environmental infrastructure projects, combining Titan's construction capabilities with GreenPath's environmental expertise; and

WHEREAS, the Venturers wish to set forth the terms governing their joint venture relationship;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, the Venturers agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1 - FORMATION AND PURPOSE

1.1 Formation. The Venturers hereby form a joint venture (the "Joint Venture") under the name "Titan-GreenPath Sustainable Infrastructure JV" (the "JV"). The Joint Venture shall not constitute a partnership, corporation, or limited liability company unless the Venturers subsequently agree in writing to form a separate legal entity.

1.2 Purpose. The purpose of the Joint Venture is to: (a) pursue, bid on, and negotiate contracts for sustainable construction and environmental infrastructure projects ("Projects"); (b) perform the work required under awarded Project contracts; (c) share profits, losses, risks, and rewards from such Projects; and (d) leverage the combined capabilities and resources of the Venturers.

1.3 Scope. The Joint Venture shall be limited to Projects that: (a) have a contract value of at least $10,000,000; (b) include a significant sustainable construction or environmental component; (c) are located within the continental United States; and (d) are approved by the Management Committee as described in Article 3.

1.4 Duration. The Joint Venture shall commence on the Effective Date and continue until December 31, 2031, unless extended by mutual written agreement or earlier terminated as provided herein.

ARTICLE 2 - CONTRIBUTIONS AND INTERESTS

2.1 Venture Interests. The Venturers shall hold the following interests in the Joint Venture:
    (a) Titan: Sixty percent (60%)
    (b) GreenPath: Forty percent (40%)

2.2 Initial Contributions.

    (a) Titan shall contribute: (i) an initial capital contribution of $3,000,000; (ii) construction equipment and machinery valued at $2,000,000 (as appraised by a mutually agreed independent appraiser); and (iii) the services of its construction management team.

    (b) GreenPath shall contribute: (i) an initial capital contribution of $2,000,000; (ii) a non-exclusive license to use its proprietary GreenBuild environmental technologies in connection with JV Projects; and (iii) the services of its environmental engineering and sustainability consulting team.

2.3 Additional Contributions. Additional capital contributions may be required upon unanimous approval of the Management Committee. If a Venturer fails to make a required additional contribution within thirty (30) days of notice, the contributing Venturer may: (a) make the contribution on behalf of the non-contributing Venturer, which amount shall be treated as a loan bearing interest at eight percent (8%) per annum; or (b) adjust the Venture Interests proportionally to reflect the actual contributions made.

2.4 Capital Accounts. The Joint Venture shall maintain separate capital accounts for each Venturer. Each capital account shall be credited with the Venturer's contributions and share of profits, and debited with distributions and share of losses.

ARTICLE 3 - MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE

3.1 Management Committee. The Joint Venture shall be governed by a Management Committee (the "Committee") consisting of four (4) members: two (2) appointed by Titan and two (2) appointed by GreenPath.

3.2 Committee Chair. The Committee Chair shall be appointed by Titan. The Committee Chair shall preside over meetings, set the agenda, and have the casting vote in the event of a tie. [ANOMALY: Contradicts Section 3.4 which requires unanimous consent for major decisions - a casting vote would override GreenPath on major decisions]

3.3 Meetings. The Committee shall meet at least monthly, either in person or by video conference. Special meetings may be called by any Committee member with at least five (5) business days' notice. A quorum for Committee meetings shall consist of at least three (3) members, with at least one (1) member from each Venturer present.

3.4 Decision-Making.

    (a) Ordinary Decisions: Day-to-day operational decisions may be made by a simple majority of the Committee members present at a duly convened meeting.

    (b) Major Decisions: The following decisions require the unanimous consent of all Committee members:
        (i) Entering into or modifying any Project contract with a value exceeding $25,000,000;
        (ii) Incurring debt or financial obligations exceeding $5,000,000;
        (iii) Acquiring or disposing of assets with a value exceeding $2,000,000;
        (iv) Admitting new Venturers or modifying Venture Interests;
        (v) Settling claims or litigation exceeding $1,000,000;
        (vi) Changing the scope or purpose of the Joint Venture;
        (vii) Amending this Agreement; and
        (viii) Approving the annual budget.
    [ANOMALY: Requiring "unanimous consent of all Committee members" for major decisions contradicts Section 3.2's casting vote for the Chair. If unanimous consent is truly required, the casting vote provision is meaningless for major decisions, creating ambiguity about which provision controls]

3.5 Project Management. For each Project, the Committee shall designate a Project Manager. Unless otherwise agreed: (a) Titan shall provide the Project Manager for Projects where construction activities represent more than sixty percent (60%) of the contract value; and (b) GreenPath shall provide the Project Manager for Projects where environmental services represent more than forty percent (40%) of the contract value. [ANOMALY: The percentages overlap - a project where construction is 55% and environmental is 45% could have either party designated as PM under both clauses]

3.6 Deadlock Resolution. If the Committee is unable to reach a required decision after two (2) consecutive meetings, the matter shall be referred to the Chief Executive Officers (or equivalent) of each Venturer for resolution within fifteen (15) days. If the CEOs cannot resolve the deadlock, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with Article 11.

ARTICLE 4 - FINANCIAL PROVISIONS

4.1 Bank Accounts. The Joint Venture shall maintain separate bank accounts. All signatories must be approved by the Committee. Withdrawals exceeding $100,000 shall require two (2) signatures, one from each Venturer's designated representative.

4.2 Books and Records. The Joint Venture shall maintain complete and accurate books and records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Each Venturer shall have the right to inspect and audit the Joint Venture's books and records at any reasonable time.

4.3 Fiscal Year. The fiscal year of the Joint Venture shall be the calendar year.

4.4 Financial Reporting. The Joint Venture's designated accountant shall prepare and distribute to each Venturer: (a) monthly financial statements within twenty (20) days of month-end; (b) quarterly financial reports within thirty (30) days of quarter-end; and (c) annual audited financial statements within ninety (90) days of year-end.

4.5 Tax Returns. The Joint Venture shall file all required tax returns. Each Venturer shall be responsible for its own income tax obligations arising from its participation in the Joint Venture.

ARTICLE 5 - PROFIT AND LOSS DISTRIBUTION

5.1 Allocation. Profits and losses of the Joint Venture shall be allocated to the Venturers in proportion to their respective Venture Interests, subject to the provisions of this Article 5. [ANOMALY: "Subject to the provisions of this Article 5" creates ambiguity because Section 5.3 creates a different allocation scheme that may override the proportional sharing]

5.2 Distributions. Distributable cash shall be distributed to the Venturers quarterly, within thirty (30) days of the end of each fiscal quarter, provided that: (a) all current obligations of the Joint Venture have been satisfied; (b) reasonable reserves have been established for future obligations; and (c) the Committee has approved the distribution.

5.3 Performance Incentive. Notwithstanding Section 5.1, if the Joint Venture's net profit margin on any individual Project exceeds fifteen percent (15%), the excess profit above the fifteen percent (15%) margin shall be allocated as follows: sixty-five percent (65%) to the Venturer that served as Project Manager for such Project, and thirty-five percent (35%) to the other Venturer, regardless of Venture Interests. [ANOMALY: This provision could significantly alter the 60/40 split established in Section 2.1, and when combined with the ambiguity in Section 3.5 about PM designation, creates unpredictable profit allocation. Also contradicts Section 5.1's statement that profits are allocated "in proportion to their respective Venture Interests"]

5.4 Losses. Losses shall be allocated in proportion to Venture Interests. However, no Venturer shall be allocated losses that would cause its capital account balance to be negative. Excess losses shall be allocated to the other Venturer.

5.5 Tax Distributions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Joint Venture shall distribute to each Venturer, on a quarterly estimated basis, an amount sufficient to cover such Venturer's estimated tax liability attributable to its share of Joint Venture income, calculated at the highest applicable marginal tax rate.

ARTICLE 6 - RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE VENTURERS

6.1 Titan Responsibilities. Titan shall be primarily responsible for:
    (a) General construction management and oversight;

6.4 Commitment. Each Venturer shall dedicate adequate resources, personnel, and attention to the Joint Venture and shall not allow its other business activities to interfere materially with its obligations hereunder. [ANOMALY: "Adequate" and "materially" are subjective and undefined]

ARTICLE 7 - NON-COMPETE AND EXCLUSIVITY

7.1 Non-Compete. During the term of this Agreement, neither Venturer shall independently bid on, pursue, or accept any Project that falls within the scope defined in Section 1.3 without first offering the opportunity to the Joint Venture. If the Committee declines the opportunity, the Venturer that identified it may pursue it independently.

7.2 Exceptions. Section 7.1 shall not apply to: (a) projects that do not meet the criteria in Section 1.3; (b) projects awarded before the Effective Date; (c) ongoing relationships with existing clients for services outside the scope of the Joint Venture; or (d) projects in which the other Venturer has a conflict of interest.

7.3 Duration. The non-compete obligations shall remain in effect during the term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years following termination, except that if termination is for cause by one Venturer against the other, the non-compete shall not apply to the non-breaching Venturer.

ARTICLE 8 - CONFIDENTIALITY

8.1 Confidential Information. Each Venturer's trade secrets, proprietary technologies, client relationships, bidding strategies, financial information, and business plans constitute Confidential Information.

8.2 Obligations. Each Venturer shall: (a) maintain the other Venturer's Confidential Information in strict confidence; (b) use such information only for Joint Venture purposes; and (c) not disclose such information to third parties without written consent.

8.3 Exceptions. Standard exceptions apply for publicly available information, independently developed information, information received from third parties without restriction, and legally compelled disclosures.

8.4 Proprietary Technology. GreenPath's proprietary GreenBuild technologies, including all technical specifications, algorithms, and know-how, shall remain GreenPath's exclusive property and shall constitute Confidential Information subject to enhanced protections. Titan shall not reverse engineer, copy, or adapt GreenBuild technologies outside the scope of JV Projects.

8.5 Duration. Confidentiality obligations survive termination for five (5) years; obligations regarding trade secrets and proprietary technologies survive indefinitely.

ARTICLE 9 - INSURANCE AND INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 JV Insurance. The Joint Venture shall maintain: (a) Commercial General Liability of $5,000,000 per occurrence; (b) Professional Liability of $5,000,000 per claim; (c) Pollution Liability of $10,000,000 per occurrence; (d) Builder's Risk as required by Project contracts; and (e) Workers' Compensation as required by law.

9.2 Venturer Insurance. Each Venturer shall maintain its own insurance as customary for its respective industry.

9.3 Cross-Indemnification. Each Venturer shall indemnify and hold harmless the other Venturer from claims arising from: (a) the indemnifying Venturer's negligence or willful misconduct; (b) the indemnifying Venturer's breach of this Agreement; (c) bodily injury or property damage caused by the indemnifying Venturer's personnel; or (d) the indemnifying Venturer's violation of applicable law.

9.4 Joint Liability. The Venturers acknowledge that they may be jointly and severally liable to Project clients and third parties. As between the Venturers, liability shall be allocated in proportion to fault, or if fault cannot be determined, in proportion to Venture Interests.

ARTICLE 10 - WITHDRAWAL AND TERMINATION

10.1 Voluntary Withdrawal. A Venturer may withdraw from the Joint Venture upon twelve (12) months' written notice, provided that: (a) all current Projects are completed or arrangements are made for completion; (b) the withdrawing Venturer satisfies all outstanding financial obligations; and (c) the withdrawing Venturer's interest is valued and distributed as set forth in Section 10.3.

10.2 Involuntary Termination. The Joint Venture may be terminated:
    (a) By mutual written agreement of both Venturers;
    (b) Upon the expiration of the Duration set forth in Section 1.4;
    (c) Upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, or dissolution of either Venturer;
    (d) By either Venturer if the other materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure within sixty (60) days of written notice; or
    (e) If the Joint Venture has not been awarded a new Project within any consecutive eighteen (18) month period.

10.3 Buyout Right. Upon withdrawal or termination under Sections 10.1 or 10.2(d):
    (a) The remaining Venturer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the departing Venturer's interest at fair market value determined by an independent appraiser mutually selected by the Venturers;
    (b) If the Venturers cannot agree on an appraiser within thirty (30) days, each Venturer shall select an appraiser and the two appraisers shall select a third, with the fair market value determined by the average of the three appraisals;
    (c) Payment may be made in a lump sum or in equal quarterly installments over twenty-four (24) months with interest at the prime rate plus two percent (2%).

10.4 Titan's Buyout Discount. Notwithstanding Section 10.3, if GreenPath withdraws voluntarily under Section 10.1 during the first three (3) years of the Joint Venture, Titan shall be entitled to purchase GreenPath's interest at a fifteen percent (15%) discount to fair market value. [ANOMALY: Asymmetric - only GreenPath faces a discount penalty for early withdrawal; Titan faces no such penalty. This may discourage GreenPath from exercising its withdrawal right]

10.5 Wind-Down. Upon termination, the Venturers shall: (a) complete all existing Project obligations; (b) collect all receivables; (c) pay all debts and liabilities; (d) distribute remaining assets to the Venturers in proportion to their capital account balances; and (e) file all required tax returns and dissolution documents.

ARTICLE 11 - DISPUTE RESOLUTION

11.1 Escalation. Disputes shall first be discussed between the Committee members involved. If not resolved within fifteen (15) days, the dispute shall be escalated to the CEOs of both Venturers.

11.2 Mediation. If the CEOs cannot resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days, the dispute shall be submitted to mediation in Miami, Florida, under the rules of the American Arbitration Association.

11.3 Arbitration. If mediation fails within sixty (60) days, the dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration in Miami, Florida, conducted by three (3) arbitrators (one selected by each Venturer and a third selected by the two appointed arbitrators) in accordance with AAA Construction Industry Arbitration Rules.

11.4 Continuation of Performance. Pending resolution of any dispute, the Venturers shall continue to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and under any active Project contracts, unless doing so would be commercially unreasonable. [ANOMALY: "Commercially unreasonable" is subjective and undefined, potentially allowing a Venturer to suspend performance during a dispute]

ARTICLE 12 - GOVERNING LAW

12.1 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to conflict of laws principles.

12.2 Venue. Any litigation arising under this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Miami-Dade County, Florida.

ARTICLE 13 - GENERAL PROVISIONS

13.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Venturers regarding the Joint Venture.

13.2 Amendments. Amendments require the written consent of both Venturers. [ANOMALY: This appears to contradict Section 3.4(b)(vii) which requires "unanimous consent of all Committee members" to amend. The Committee has four members while only two Venturers exist - the amendment standard is different]

13.3 Waiver. No waiver shall be effective unless in writing.

13.4 Severability. Invalid provisions shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary.

13.5 Notices. All notices shall be in writing and delivered by certified mail, overnight courier, or email with confirmation to the addresses in the preamble.

13.6 Further Assurances. Each Venturer shall execute and deliver such additional documents and take such additional actions as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

13.7 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is for the exclusive benefit of the Venturers and does not create any rights in third parties.

13.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts.

[NOTE: No Force Majeure clause - ANOMALY: Missing for a construction joint venture where weather, supply chain, and labor issues are common]

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Venturers have executed this Agreement as of the Effective Date.
