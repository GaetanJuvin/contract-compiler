2.3 Schedule Updates. Contractor shall provide Supplier with updated Project schedules as they are issued. Supplier shall adjust its delivery schedule accordingly and shall notify Contractor within five (5) business days if any schedule change creates a delivery conflict.

2.4 Expedited Delivery. Contractor may request expedited delivery with less than fifteen (15) business days' notice. Supplier shall use commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate such requests, and any premium charges for expedited delivery shall be quoted and approved in writing prior to incurrence.

ARTICLE 3 - PRICING

[ANOMALY: Pricing inconsistency - stated totals do not match unit prices times quantities]
3.1 Unit Prices. The unit prices for Materials are set forth in Appendix A. Prices are firm and fixed for the duration of the Project, subject to the steel price escalation provision in Section 3.3.

3.2 Project Estimate. Based on the quantities estimated in the Project construction documents, the total estimated value of Materials to be supplied under this Agreement is approximately Six Million Eight Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($6,850,000), broken down as follows:
    (a) Structural Steel: 1,200 tons at $1,850/ton = $2,220,000
    (b) Reinforcing Bar: 950 tons at $1,100/ton = $1,045,000
    (c) Ready-Mix Concrete: 18,000 cubic yards at $145/CY = $2,610,000
    (d) Concrete Masonry Units: 85,000 units at $4.75/unit = $403,750
    (e) Structural Bolts/Connectors: Lump sum = $187,500
    (f) Waterproofing: Lump sum = $225,000
    (g) Precast Panels: 120 panels at $2,800/panel = $336,000

    [Note: Items (a) through (g) total $7,027,250, not the stated $6,850,000. There is a $177,250 discrepancy.]

3.3 Steel Price Escalation. If the published price of structural steel (as reported in the American Metal Market) increases or decreases by more than eight percent (8%) from the base price at the time of this Agreement, the unit price for structural steel shall be adjusted proportionally. The base price index is $1,850 per ton as of the date of this Agreement.

3.4 Quantity Variations. Actual quantities may vary from the estimates in Section 3.2 by up to fifteen percent (15%) without affecting unit prices. Quantity variations exceeding fifteen percent (15%) shall be subject to price renegotiation.

3.5 No Hidden Charges. The unit prices include all costs of manufacturing, fabrication, testing, certifications, and loading at Supplier's facility. Transportation to the Project site shall be a separate line item as specified in Appendix A.

If test results indicate non-compliance, Supplier shall bear all costs of investigation and remediation.

5.4 Third-Party Testing. Contractor reserves the right to conduct independent third-party testing of any Materials at any time. If Materials fail testing, Supplier shall bear the cost of testing, replacement materials, and any associated delays.
