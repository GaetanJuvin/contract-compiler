If Buyer shall fail to make any payment pursuant to this Agreement when due, any such late payment shall bear interest, to the extent not prohibited by Law, at a per annum rate equal to the U.S. Prime Rate, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, for the first date on which such payment was delinquent, plus 2.0%, beginning on the first date on which such payment was delinquent and ending on the date on which such payment is made, calculated based on the actual number of days such payment is overdue.  

3.2.3    Default.  With respect to defaults of payment not cured within 30 days after receipt of written notice from Seller to Buyer, Seller shall, in its sole discretion, and without prejudice to any other of its accrued rights, be entitled to suspend the provision of the Product, which suspension shall not result in or constitute a breach of any of Seller’s obligations under this Agreement.

Buyer is responsible for establishing appropriate performance characteristics for downstream applications using Product.  

4.1.2    Exclusion of Other Warranties.  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, SELLER MAKES NO WARRANTY IN RESPECT OF THE PRODUCT SUPPLIED HEREUNDER, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED BY STATUTE, CUSTOM OF THE TRADE OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY RELATING TO THE DESCRIPTION OR QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT, ITS MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE UNDER ANY CONDITIONS, AND ANY SUCH WARRANTY IS HEREBY EXCLUDED.

4.2    Rejection of Products.    Within 30 days after Buyer’s receipt thereof, Buyer may reject any Product supplied hereunder that at the time of delivery does not conform to the warranties set forth in Section 4.1.1 (“Non-Conforming Product”), provided that such Non-Conforming Product.  Buyer shall provide written notice to Seller specifying the reason for such rejection.  For the avoidance of doubt, Non-Conforming Product shall not include any Product that has become non-conforming due, in whole or in part, to any failure by the carrier or Buyer or its agents or representatives to handle, maintain, operate, or store such Product as required by the labeling or the Specifications.

4.3    Product Return/Replacement.  At the request of Seller, Buyer shall return the Non-Conforming Product, or a representative sample thereof, to Seller for testing.  Should such test results reasonably confirm the Product is Non-Conforming Product, Buyer shall return said Non-Conforming Product quantities to Seller’s office at Seller’s expense, and Seller shall send conforming replacement Product to Buyer at no additional cost to Buyer.   Seller shall ship such conforming Product within 45 days of such confirming test results.  Should such test results fail to confirm the non-conformance of the Product with the Specifications, and should the Parties fail to otherwise resolve the dispute, the Parties shall submit the Product, or a representative sample thereof, along with a reference batch that has previously been shown by Buyer to conform to the Specifications, to a mutually acceptable independent laboratory along with the test protocols described in the Specifications and mutually agreeable interrogatories to be answered by such laboratory.  If such independent laboratory is not appointed within 14 days after one of the Parties has indicated to desire such appointment, CEDRA Corporation (www.cedracorp.com, 8605 Cross Park Drive, Austin, Texas 78754) (“CEDRA”) will be appointed.  If CEDRA is unable to perform the services required to resolve the Product’s conformance or non-conformance to the Specifications, the Parties will agree to CEDRA’s recommendation for an alternate independent laboratory.  The determination of the Product’s conformance or non-conformance to the Specifications by such independent laboratory shall be binding upon the Parties.  If the laboratory determines that the Product conforms to the Specifications, Buyer shall pay all independent laboratory and shipping costs incurred by Seller, and should such laboratory confirm that the Product is Non-Conforming Product, Seller shall pay all shipping and independent laboratory costs incurred by Buyer.  Sections 4.3 and 4.4 shall be




the sole remedies available to Buyer for Non-Conforming Product. 

4.4    Product Recall.  If Buyer is required by any Governmental Authority to effect a recall of Product in the field because of the Product being Non-Conforming Product, Seller shall reimburse Buyer for the documented out-of-pocket costs incurred in such recall, such as cost of communications to customers, shipping of recalled Product and disposal thereof and shipping of conforming Product back to customers.

The suspension of performance shall be of no greater scope and no longer duration than is necessary and the non-performing Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy its inability to perform.  

8.2    Severability.

8.10    Independent Contractors.  In the exercise of their respective rights, and the performance of their respective obligations, under this Agreement, the Parties are, and shall remain, independent contractors.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to constitute the Parties as partners, joint venturers, or participants in a joint enterprise or undertaking, or to constitute either of the Parties as the agent of the other Party for any purpose whatsoever.  Neither Party shall bind, or attempt to bind, the other Party to any contract or the performance of any other obligation, or represent to any Third Party that it is authorized to enter into any




contract or binding obligation on behalf of the other Party. 

8.11    Equitable Relief.  The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.  It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.  Each Party hereby waives (a) any requirement that the other Party post a bond or other security as a condition for obtaining any such relief, and (b) any defenses in any action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate. 

8.12    English Language.  This Agreement shall be written and executed in, and all other communications under or in connection with this Agreement shall be in, the English language.  Any translation into any other language shall not be an official version thereof, and in the event of any conflict in interpretation between the English version and such translation, the English version shall control.

8.13    Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and each such counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an original instrument, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one agreement.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed original counterpart of this Agreement.

8.14    Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, together with the Schedules and Exhibits expressly contemplated hereby and attached hereto, the Asset Purchase Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements, contain the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the Transactions and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, promises and representations, whether written or oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.  In the event of any inconsistency between any such Schedules and Exhibits and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.  

8.15    Construction.  Except where the context otherwise requires, wherever used, the singular includes the plural, the plural the singular, the use of any gender shall be applicable to all genders and the word “or” is used in the inclusive sense (and/or).  The captions of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and in no way define, describe, extend or limit the scope or intent of this Agreement or the intent of any provision contained in this Agreement.  The term “including” as used herein does not limit the generality of any description preceding such term.
