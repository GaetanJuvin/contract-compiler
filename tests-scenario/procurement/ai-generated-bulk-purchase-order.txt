This Master Bulk Purchase Order Agreement ("Agreement") is made and entered into by and between:

PURCHASER: Grandview Hospitality Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation, located at 8900 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Las Vegas, NV 89123 ("Purchaser")

RECITALS

WHEREAS, Purchaser operates a chain of hotels, resorts, and conference centers across the United States and requires large quantities of commercial furniture, fixtures, and equipment ("FF&E");

WHEREAS, Vendor is a manufacturer and wholesale distributor of commercial-grade FF&E products; and

WHEREAS, Purchaser desires to enter into a bulk purchase arrangement with Vendor to secure favorable pricing, priority allocation, and streamlined ordering for its FF&E requirements;

NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:

SECTION 1 - PRODUCTS AND QUANTITIES

1.1 Products. Vendor shall sell and Purchaser shall purchase the commercial furniture, fixtures, and equipment described in Attachment A ("Products"). Products include but are not limited to: guest room furniture sets, lobby seating, conference tables, banquet chairs, and custom millwork.

1.2 Committed Volumes. Purchaser commits to purchasing a minimum of Three Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($3,500,000) worth of Products during each contract year (the "Annual Minimum Commitment").

1.3 Volume Tiers. Pricing shall be based on the following annual purchase volume tiers:
    Tier 1: $0 - $2,000,000 - Standard pricing per Attachment A
    Tier 2: $2,000,001 - $5,000,000 - 8% discount off standard pricing
    Tier 3: $5,000,001 - $10,000,000 - 14% discount off standard pricing
    Tier 4: Over $10,000,000 - 19% discount off standard pricing

[ANOMALY: Pricing inconsistency - unit prices in Section 1.4 do not match volume tier discounts]
1.4 Unit Pricing for Key Items. The following unit prices shall apply regardless of volume tier:
    (a) Standard Guest Room Set (Model GR-400): $2,850 per set
    (b) Executive Suite Set (Model ES-700): $6,200 per set
    (c) Conference Table, 12-seat (Model CT-12): $3,475 each
    (d) Banquet Chair, Stackable (Model BC-100): $189 each
    (e) Lobby Sofa, 3-seat (Model LS-300): $4,100 each

    For the avoidance of doubt, an order of 800 Standard Guest Room Sets shall be priced at a total of $2,394,000, inclusive of all applicable discounts.

    [Note: 800 x $2,850 = $2,280,000, not $2,394,000. The stated total is inconsistent with the unit price.]
